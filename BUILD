BUILD
	To build AdvanceSCAN you need a C/C++ compiler.

	Tested with the following compilers on a GNU/Linux
	environment :

		GNU gcc 2.95.3
		GNU gcc 3.0.4
		GNU gcc 3.1

	The build process on the DOS platform isn't tested. The DOS
	and Windows binaries are generated in Linux cross compiling.
	If you have the cross compiler installed, you can try the
	configure.msdos and configure.windows configuration scripts.
