.SH DESCRIPTION 
The main purpose of this utility is to recompress MNG
files to get the smallest possible size.
.PP
It\(cqs able to read the MNG file generated by AdvanceMAME
and to compress them using the Delta and the Move MNG
features. Please note that this utility is not able to read
a generic MNG file.
.PP
The delta optimization is always active and it can
compress video clips with only small changes between frames.
.PP
The scroll optimization is used only on request (option
\(a"\(hys HxV\(a") and it can compress better video clips with a
scrolling background.
.SH OPTIONS 
.TP
.B \(hyl, \(hy\(hylist FILES...
List the content of the specified files.
.TP
.B \(hyz, \(hy\(hyrecompress FILES...
Recompress the specified files. If the \(hy1, \(hy2, \(hy3
options are specified is used the smallest file
choice from the previous compressed data and the
new compression. If the \(hy0 option is specified the
file is always rewritten without any compression.
.TP
.B \(hy0, \(hy\(hyshrink\(hy0
Set the compression level to \(a"none\(a". The file are
only stored and not compressed. The file is always
rewritten also if it\(cqs bigger.
.TP
.B \(hy1, \(hy\(hyshrink\(hy1
Set the compression level to \(a"normal\(a". This is the
default level of compression.
.TP
.B \(hy2, \(hy\(hyshrink\(hy2
Set the compression level to \(a"extra\(a". It\(cqs SLOW.
.TP
.B \(hy3, \(hy\(hyshrink\(hy3
Set the compression level to \(a"extreme\(a". It\(cqs VERY
SLOW.
.TP
.B \(hys, \(hy\(hyscroll HxV
The \(a"\(hys HxV\(a" option specifies the size of the pattern
(H width x V height) used to check for a
scrolling background. The size is expressed in
pixel and it must be bigger or equal than the
scrolling speed of the background. For example
take the game 1942 that scroll vertically by 1
pixel every frame. If you recorded with an interleave
factor of 2 the vertical scrolling speed is
1*2 = 2. In this case the minimun pattern is \(a"\(hys 0x2\(a".
Generally you can use \(a"\(hys 4x4\(a" and use bigger
value only for games scrolling faster. If the
game scroll only horizontally or vertically you can
speed up a lot the compression with monodirectional
patterns like \(a"\(hys 8x0\(a" or \(a"\(hys 0x8\(a".
.TP
.B \(hyr, \(hy\(hyreduce
Force always the color reduction to 8 bit. The
compression will fail if exists a frame with more than
256 colors.
.TP
.B \(hye, \(hy\(hyexpand
Force always the color expansion to 24 bit.
.TP
.B \(hyc, \(hy\(hylc
Force the use of the MNG LC (Low Complexity)
specifications. It disables the delta compression. The
file is always rewritten also if it\(cqs bigger.
.TP
.B \(hyC, \(hy\(hyvlc
Force the use of the MNG VLC (Very Low Complexity)
specifications. It disables the delta compression
and the precise timing. Warning! you may lose the
correct timing information because the VLC format
only support integer frequency. The file is always
rewritten also if it\(cqs bigger.
.TP
.B \(hyf, \(hy\(hyforce
Force the use of the new file also if it\(cqs bigger.
