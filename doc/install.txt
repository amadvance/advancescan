==============

To build AdvanceSCAN you need a C/C++ compiler.

Tested with the following compilers on a GNU/Linux
environment :

    GNU gcc 2.95.3
    GNU gcc 3.0.4
    GNU gcc 3.1

The build process on the DOS platform isn't tested. The DOS
and Windows binaries are generated in Linux cross compiling.
If you have the cross compiler installed, you can try the
configure.msdos and configure.windows configuration scripts.
