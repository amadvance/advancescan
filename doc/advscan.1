.SH DESCRIPTION 
advscan is a command line utility for maintaining a zipped
archive of roms and sample zip archive for the MAME, MESS,
xmame, AdvanceMAME, AdvanceMESS and Raine emulators.
The goal of advscan is to obtain a complete and perfect rom
and sample zip archive with differential merging.
.PP
Differential merging means that any game has its zip archive,
which contains all the rom files, which are not already in
the parent zip archive (if exists).
.PP
advscan has these features:
.PD 0
.IP \(bu
Directly read, writes zip archives without decompressing
and recompressing them for best performance.
.IP \(bu
Add, copy, move and rename files in the zip
archives. Any rom that you have is placed
automatically in the correct zip.
.IP \(bu
Recognizes the text files added by rom sites and
delete them.
.IP \(bu
Recognizes the text files added by the rom dumpers
and keep or delete them as your choice.
.IP \(bu
It\(cqs safe. On all the zip operations any file
removed or overwritten is saved in the
\(oqrom_unknown\(cq \(oqsample_unknown\(cq directories and keep
for future uses. This will prevent any unwanted
remove operation.
.PD
.PP
but also has these misfeatures:
.PD 0
.IP \(bu
Supports only rom and sample archives zipped.
.IP \(bu
Supports only rom organized with differential merging.
.IP \(bu
Doesn\(cqt support .chd files in subdirectories.
.PD
.SH OPTIONS 
.TP
.B \(hyc, \(hy\(hycfg CONFIG
Select the configuration file. If not specified is
assumed the file \(oqadvscan.rc\(cq in the current
directory.
.TP
.B < info.lst/xml
To operate advscan needs always as input a rom
information file. It can be generally created with
the \(hylistinfo/\(hylistxml (MAME) or \(hygameinfo (Raine)
options of the emulator. If the first not space
char of the file is a \(oq<\(cq, the file is assumed to be
xml, otherwise it\(cqs assumed to be the old listing format.
.TP
.B \(hyr, \(hy\(hyrom
Operates on roms (.zip files). All the next commands
will operate on your romset.
.TP
.B \(hys, \(hy\(hysample
Operates on samples. All the next commands will
operate on your sampleset.
.TP
.B \(hyk, \(hy\(hydisk
Operates on disks (.chd files). All the next commands
will operate on your diskset.
.TP
.B \(hya, \(hy\(hyadd\(hyzip
Add the missing rom zips. Any missing zip archive
for which at least one rom is available will be created.
.TP
.B \(hyb, \(hy\(hyadd\(hybin
Add, rename and substitute all the necessary files
in the existing zip archives. No new zip archives
are created, only the already present zip files are
modified. No file is deleted. Anyway, some files may
be overwritten. Any file overwritten is saved in
the \(oqrom_unknown\(cq or \(oqsample_unknown\(cq directory in
a zip archive with the same name of the original
one.
.TP
.B \(hyd, \(hy\(hydel\(hyzip
Remove any unknown zip or chd archive. Any archive
removed is saved in the \(oqrom_unknown\(cq,
\(oqsample_unknown\(cq or \(oqdisk_unknown\(cq directory.
.TP
.B \(hyu, \(hy\(hydel\(hyunknown
Remove any unknown file from the existing zip
archives. Any file removed is saved in the
\(oqrom_unknown\(cq or \(oqsample_unknown\(cq directory in a
zip archive with the same name of the original one.
Only binary files are removed, all the text files
are keep.
.TP
.B \(hyg, \(hy\(hydel\(hygarbage
Remove any garbage file from the zip archives. A
garbage file is an advertising text file added
generally by a rom site. The files removed are not
saved.
.TP
.B \(hyt, \(hy\(hydel\(hytext
Remove any text file from the zip archives. Any
file removed is saved in the \(oqrom_unknown\(cq or
\(oqsample_unknown\(cq directory in a zip archive with the
same name of the original one.
.TP
.B \(hyR, \(hy\(hyrom\(hystd
Shortcut for the options \(hyrabdug. It does all the
previous operations on roms except removing text
files.
.TP
.B \(hyS, \(hy\(hysample\(hystd
Shortcut for the options \(hysabdug. It does all the
previous operations on samples except removing text
files.
.TP
.B \(hyK, \(hy\(hydisk\(hystd
Shortcut for the options \(hykd. It moves any unknown
disk file in the disk_unknown directory.
.TP
.B \(hyn, \(hy\(hyprint\(hyonly
Don\(cqt modify anything, it only shows operations.
This option prevents any changes made by the
previous commands. The operations are only printed and
NOT executed.
.TP
.B \(hyp, \(hy\(hyreport
Write an extensive text report with the list of
good, bad and missing roms or/and samples. The
content of any zip archive with missing files is
printed. You must also specify the \(hyr or/and \(hys
options.
.TP
.B \(hyP, \(hy\(hyreport\(hyfile
Write a small text report with information on the
present files, listing incomplete, duplicate or
missing required zips.
.TP
.B \(hyf, \(hy\(hyfilter FILTER
Apply a specific filter at the rom list. Check the
FILTERS chapter for a detailed list of filters available.
.TP
.B \(hyv, \(hy\(hyverbose
Print a more verbose report. The content of any zip
archive is printed also if it contains at least one
not rom file.
.SH INFORMATION OPTIONS 
The following options are used only to print information.
These options don\(cqt need or read the configuration file.
.TP
.B \(hyi, \(hy\(hyident files...
Identify the files specified. Only the information
present in the info file is used.
.TP
.B \(hyl, \(hy\(hybbs
Print a standard \(oq.bbs\(cq files with the description
of all the roms in the info file.
.TP
.B \(hye, \(hy\(hyequal
Print a list of all the duplicate roms present in
the info file. Only the information present in the
info file is used.
.TP
.B \(hyh, \(hy\(hyhelp
Print a short help screen.
.TP
.B \(hyV, \(hy\(hyversion
Print the program version.
.SH IDENTIFICATION 
Rom files are identified by their crc and size. The roms
are not really decompressed, but the crc value stored on
the zip archives is used. If a rom has an incorrect crc or
size, but it has a correct name, it\(cqs maintained if
doesn\(cqt exist a valid alternative.
.PP
Sample files are identified only by their names. This
limits the possible operations. Essentially advscan can
report only missing samples.
.PP
Garbage files are identified by their size and crc.
.PP
All the others files are identified with this algorithm:
.PD 0
.IP \(bu
If the name is like *.sam, *.wav it\(cqs considered an
unknown binary file.
.IP \(bu
If the name is something like *.doc, *.txt, *.nfo,
*.diz, readme.* it\(cqs considered a text file.
.IP \(bu
If the size is a power of 2 it\(cqs considered an
unknown binary file.
.IP \(bu
It\(cqs considered a text file.
.PD
.SH CONFIGURATION 
To run advscan you need two files. The rom information
file and the configuration file.
.PP
The rom information file is the file that contains the
information of all the roms used by the emulator. It can
be made with the command:
.PP
.RS 4
advmame \(hylistxml > info.xml
.PD 0
.PP
.PD
.RE
.PP
This file is expected as input of advscan. So, you can use
this command:
.PP
.RS 4
advscan [options] < info.xml
.PD 0
.PP
.PD
.RE
.PP
Or combine the two commands together:
.PP
.RS 4
advmame \(hylistxml | advscan [options]
.PD 0
.PP
.PD
.RE
.PP
The configuration file is a text file that describes your
directories structure. You can use absolute path or
relative path. Relative path is relative to the current
directory from where you run advscan.
.PP
In Unix the PATH separator is \(oq:\(cq. In DOS and Windows the PATH
separator is \(oq;\(cq. The following options are expressed with the
Unix format.
.TP
.B rom PATH:PATH...
List of paths where the roms are placed. These are
the zip archives, which are modified and fixed.
.TP
.B rom_new PATH
Single path where the new created zip archives are
placed. It\(cqs STRONGLY suggested to put this path
ALSO in the \(oqrom\(cq specification. Otherwise at the
next run the zip archives are recreated.
.TP
.B rom_import PATH:PATH...
List of directory trees where other roms files are
placed. These are used for importing rom file missing
in rompath. These files are only read and never
modified in any way. It\(cqs very useful to insert
here any rom directories of any other arcade
emulators. When a new game will be supported the rom
archive will be made automatically.
.TP
.B rom_unknown PATH
Single path where unknown rom zip archives will be
moved. In this directory is inserted any rom file
removed from the rom zip archives. However, any rom
file is automatically deleted by advscan if it\(cqs
duplicated in an archive listed on the \(oqrom\(cq or
\(oqrom_import\(cq options.
.TP
.B sample PATH:PATH...
List of paths where the samples are placed. These
are the zip archives, which are modified and fixed.
.TP
.B sample_unknown PATH
Single path where unknown sample zip archives will
be moved. In this directory is inserted any sample
file removed from the sample zip archives.
.TP
.B disk PATH:PATH...
List of paths where the disks are placed. These
are the chd archives.
.TP
.B disk_unknown PATH
Single path where unknown disk chd archives will
be moved.
.PP
If the \(hyc option is not specified the configuration file
is read from ./advscan.rc.
.PP
The files advscan.rc.linux and advscan.rc.dos are two
examples of configuration files.
.SH DAMAGED FILES 
If a damaged .zip or .chd file is detected, it\(cqs renamed
with a new name appending the extension \(a".damaged\(a".
For .chd file it may happen that the file is a disk image
with an old format.
.PP
If the rename operation isn\(cqt possible the program aborts.
.PP
Please note that the program doesn\(cqt execute an
extensive test to detect damaged files.
.SH FILTERS 
As default advscan uses all the rom definitions, including also
unplayable games. If you prefere you can use only a subset
of the roms defined with the \(hy\(hyfilter option.
.PP
The filters available are:
.RS 4
.PD 0
.HP 4
.I working
Use only working roms. A working rom is a rom
reported working or a rom needed by another working
rom. A rom is reported working if it isn\(cqt marked
with the \(a"preliminary\(a" flag in the driver, video or
sound. This should be the preferred filter which only
store playable games.
.HP 4
.I preliminary
Use only roms which are not in the \(a"working\(a"
subset.
.HP 4
.I working_parent
Use only working parent roms from the
\(a"working\(a" subset excluding clones. If a parent rom
is not working but it has a working clone, both
the parent and the clone are used.
This is the preferred filter if you want only one
working game for any parent/clones group.
.HP 4
.I working_clone
Use only roms which  are in the \(a"working\(a"
subset but not in the \(a"working_parent\(a" subset.
.PD
.RE
.PP
For example, if you want to keep preliminary and working roms in
different directories, you can setup two different advscan.rc files
with different directories but sharing the \(oqrom_unknown\(cq dir to allow
automatic rom moving between the two sets.
If this is your configuration, to update your romset, you need to
run advscan three times:
.RS 4
.PD 0
.HP 4
.I on working set
To export preliminary roms in the
rom_unknown dir.
.HP 4
.I on preliminary set
To import preliminary roms and export
working roms in the rom_unknown dir.
.HP 4
.I on working set
To import working rom from the
rom_unknown dir.
.PD
.RE
.PP
For example:
.PP
.RS 4
advscan \(hyR \(hyc advscan\(hywrk.rc \(hyf working < advmame.xml > rom_wrk.log
advscan \(hyR \(hyc advscan\(hypre.rc \(hyf preliminary < advmame.xml > rom_pre.log
advscan \(hyR \(hyc advscan\(hywrk.rc \(hyf working < advmame.xml > rom_wrk.log
