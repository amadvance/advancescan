1 SYNOPSIS
==========

advdiff ORIG_INFO DEST_INFO


2 DESCRIPTION
=============

This utility prints all the games contained in the
DEST_INFO file and not contained in ORIG_INFO file.
A game is considered contained if all his roms are present
in a game with the same name.

The DEST_INFO and ORIG_INFO files are the rom information
files generated with the -listinfo or -gameinfo options of
the emulators.

You can use this utility to create differential romset.
For example you can use this command:

    advdiff mame.lst raine.lst > raine_diff.lst

to create the list of roms needed by Raine, which are not
already included in the standard MAME set.

You can also use this utility to create the list of roms,
which need to be updated between two emulator releases.
For example you can use this command:

    advdiff mame59.lst mame60.lst > mame59-60.lst

to create the list of roms needed to upgrade the MAME
romset from the version 0.59 version to the version 0.60.
