Description
</h1>
This utility prints all the games contained in the
DEST_INFO file and not contained in ORIG_INFO file.
A game is considerated contained if all his roms are present
in a game with the same name.
<p>
The DEST_INFO and ORIG_INFO files are the rom information
files generated with the -listinfo or -gameinfo options of
the emulators.
<p>
You can use this utility to create differential romset.
For example you can use this command:
<p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td width="95%">
<font face="Courier">
advdiff mame.lst raine.lst &gt; raine_diff.lst<br>
</font>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
to create the list of roms needed by Raine, which are not
already included in the standard MAME set.
<p>
You can also use this utility to create the list of roms,
which need to be updated between two emulator releases.
For example you can use this command:
<p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td width="95%">
<font face="Courier">
advdiff mame59.lst mame60.lst &gt; mame59-60.lst<br>
</font>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
to create the list of roms needed to upgrade the MAME rom
set from the 0.59 version to the 0.60 version.
